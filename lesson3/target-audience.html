            <p>Judy is 31 years old, married, and a mother of 3. She graduated from Brigham Young
                University - Idaho with a degree in Family and Consumer Science and is currently
                doing what she loves being a stay at home mom.</p>
            <p>Being at home all day, Judy loves doing anything that doesn't take too much of her
                attention away from her kids. She loves to read, bake, and watch feel-good movies.</p>
            <p>Judy also loves to scroll on her phone watching TikToks and has come across many videos
                about small businesses being shut down due to big corporations. She's a big supporter
                of local businesses so she would love to know what she can do to help keep them running.</p>

            <p>Sam is 24 years old and unmarried. He just graduated with a bachelor's degree in
                Business Marketing and currently works as a sales agent for a well known company.</p>
            <p>Working 40 hours a day, Sam doesn't feel like he has much time to do other things, but
                finds playing video games after work to be relaxing. When he does find time, he loves
                to do things outdoors like hiking and swimming.</p>
            <p>Although Sam loves his job, he has big dreams of starting his own business, but doesn't
                really know what kind of service is in demand or what he should do to get the word out
                and if he'll be supported.</p>
